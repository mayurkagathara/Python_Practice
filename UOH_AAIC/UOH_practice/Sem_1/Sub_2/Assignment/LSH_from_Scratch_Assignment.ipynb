        "  3. Ignore unigrams and make use of both **bigrams & trigrams** and also limit the **max features** to **4000** and **minimum document frequency** to **10**.\n",
        "  4. After the tfidf vectors are generated as mentioned above, next task is to generate random hyperplanes.\n",
        "  5. Generate **5 random hyperplanes**. And generate the hyperplanes using a random normal distribution with **mean zero and variance 1**. \n",
        "  6. We have set the **numpy random seed to zero**, please do not change it. And then you can make use of **np.random.normal** to generate the vectors for hyperplanes.\n",
        "  7. As mentioned in the course videos, compute the hash function and also the corresponding hash table for it.\n",
        "  8. Once the hash table is generated now take in each of the query points from the test data.\n",
        "  9. Vectorize those query points using the same tfidf vectorizer as mentioned above.\n",
        "  10. Now use the hash function on this query point and fetch all the similar data points from the hashtable.\n",
        "  11. Use cosine similarity to compute **11-Nearest Neighbours** from the list of data points obtained in the above step.\n",
        "  12. Take a majority vote among the 11-Nearest Neighbours and predict the class label for the query point in the test data.\n",
        "  13. **In case of a tie** in the obtained labels from nearest neighbours, you can pick a label after sorting all the labels **alphabetically**(A-Z), i.e. for example labels starting with A would get more preference than labels starting with Z.\n",
        "  14. Repeat steps 9 to 13 for all the points in the test data and then finally return a list with all the predicted labels.\n",
        "  15. Note that there are a total of 10 data points in the test data so the final list you return should be of length 10.\n",
        "  16. Also note that the cosine similarity function should be written from scratch, you should not directly make use of existing libraries.\n",
        "  17. Please use the formula of cosine similarity as explained in the course videos, you can make use of numpy or scipy to calculate dot or norm or transpose."
